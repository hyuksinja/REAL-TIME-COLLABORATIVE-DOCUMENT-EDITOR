This project is a Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor, a web application enabling multiple users to edit the same document concurrently. Changes made by any user are instantly synchronized across all collaborators. It features unique, shareable document URLs for easy access, ensuring persistent storage of content in a MongoDB database. Users can create new documents, copy shareable links, and explicitly save their work. Built with Node.js, Socket.IO, and a responsive frontend, it provides an intuitive platform for seamless, live document editing
